# nyc-sat-precinct-analysis
This is my submission for Project 2 in my Data Science course, which achieved a 90% grade. The project explores potential relationships between historical crime data obtained from the New York Police Department (NYPD) and literacy levels among youth, as measured by SAT scores across public schools in their respective boroughs.


## üìç Objectives
- Investigate potential relationships between historical NYPD crime data and SAT performance.
- Apply data cleaning, merging, and integration of external datasets.
- Draw insights and recommendations based on spatial and statistical analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly, sf, leaflet, dplyr, scales, lubridate, wesanderson, kableExtra)
- NYC Historical Crime Data Set
- SAT Results Kaggle
